# deploy-dnn-with-docker

This lab was conducted under the guidance of the online course “Introduction to Machine Learning in Production” in Coursera, and part of the code was provided there.

We deploy a computer vision neural network trained to detect common objects in pictures. The model has been evaluated with two different datasets.

As regards the first experiment, we follow the guidance of the lab instructions and we run our model to perform object detection on the ImageNet dataset. Regarding the second experiment, we run our model in a completely different task. Hence, we perform gender detection on the CelebA dataset.
